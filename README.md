# Library-Website
This website is an update of my university's library website based on Nielsen's Heuristics.

You can find the website here: http://dl104.madgik.di.uoa.gr/eamgroup14/main/index.php

This website gives the opportunity to the students to register and create profile in order to borrow books from the diffrent libraries of our campus.

Students through their profile can track which books they have borrowed, when to return them and ask for extensions.

It also gives you the option to search and find all the books that are available in the libraries of our campus.
